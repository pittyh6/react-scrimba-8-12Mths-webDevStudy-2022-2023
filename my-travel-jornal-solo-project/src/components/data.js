It is run smoothly under the management of showman David Atkins until 1957 and engineer Ted Hopkins until 1969. Following overseas excursions in the 1950s and 1960s, a series of new rides and attractions are installed.The remaining 6 years of the lease and equipment of Luna Park are sold to the World Trade Centre who unsuccessfully apply to redevelop the site as a multi-story Trade Centre.

The Australian Reptile Park is a hands-on interactive zoo, based in Somersby on the NSW Central Coast.The Australian Reptile Park as it is known today first opened in 1958 at Wyoming when naturalist Eric Worrell had the idea of combining snake venom production with tourism. Eric’s high public profile benefited from his many publications and television documentaries. Sadly, Eric Worrell passed away in 1987, but his dream lived on in two passionate employees John and Robyn Weigel, who financially invested in taking ownership of the Park and continue to run the tourist attraction today along fellow Directors Tim Faulkner and Liz Gabriel.",
