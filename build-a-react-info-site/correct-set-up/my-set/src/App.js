    Challenge: find out what happens if we try to append JSX

    1. Create a sample page in JSX (â‰¥ 4 elements) and save them in a variable
    2. Select the div with the ID of "root" and use `.append()` to append
      your JSX
    3. See if you can guess what will show up in the browser before running
      the code
    4. See if you can explain what actually shows up in the browser

  //quiz 13
  /*
1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
we need the dependencies React and React-dom
also, npm and node installed
* JSX syntax is defines in react

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
a javaScript object

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
You neet to wrap everything in ONE html element. You only can render ONE element.

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
imperative is when you have to give all the steps for the computer understand what it need to do. 
Declarative is when you tell just what you want and the computer/compiler knows what to do.


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.
